#  Hearts Demo

[How_many_hearts.bat](How_many_hearts.bat) is a script designed to demonstrate key concepts related to DOS.
Below is a description of what it does.

- The script displays a prompt asking, "How many hearts you would like to see?"
- The script checks if the entered number is greater than 3.
- If it is, the message "this is too many" is displayed.
- Otherwise, the script calls heart.bat that number of times.
- The heart.bat script sets the console color (using color 84).
- It then displays ASCII heart patterns to the screen the specified number of times.
